This is a simple API I created for a friend's Twitch channel. Each request pulls a random fact from a connected database. The authentication is underwhelming, just using a randomly generated API key, but at least I didn't add it to the repo :). Once upon a time, this was hosted, but it probably got removed from the free hosting site I had it on for inactivity. At the time I made this, I had just learned Node.js and MongoDB, and wanted to do a little something on my own with it.
